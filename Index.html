                <h2>HISTOIRE DU TIGRE</h2>
                <p>The monologue begins with the story of the Long March and <br>
                    of a soldier of the Communist rearguard who is wounded in the leg. The <br>
                    wound becoming infected and gangrenous, the smell is unbearable to his <br>
                    comrades and the wound slows them down, and the soldier obtains not to <br>
                    be finished but to be left on the way. <br>
                    <br>
                    He then gains a cave, forced by torrential rains. The cave is revealed to be <br>
                    inhabited by a tigress and two tigons, one of which has just died in the <br>
                    weather. But the soldier stinks too much for them to eat him. The tigress <br>
                    has breasts full of milk and her tiger, full of water, refuses to suckle her; <br>
                    she urges the man to drink her milk, and the man does so, drinking from <br>
                    one, then two, then four breasts. Sated, he falls asleep. The next day the <br>
                    scene is repeated and this time the tigress licks her wound and spits out <br>
                    the gangrene. In a few days, the wound is purified and the blood flows <br>
                    normally again. The tigress then brings back the fruit of its hunt. Man gets <br>
                    a scrap of it, which he cooks and which then pleases both animals. The <br>
                    soldier then becomes a cook in the service of the animal family, but, tired, <br>
                    runs away on a rainy day.</p>
